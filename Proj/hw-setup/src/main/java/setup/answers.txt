## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

When input 0 which is not a negative number, our program will throw Exception. I change the code
from `if (n <= 0)` to `if (n < 0)`.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

When input 0 which is not a negative number, our program will throw Exception instead of returning 1
. The precious change will solve this problem.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The original code is `if n <= 2 then return 1`. However, n = 2 is not the base case. Instead, it is
inductive case. So I change it into `if n < 2 then return 1`.

## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

x = 4, y = 0, sum = 0.
Since `x = 2 * (console.nextInt() / 2);`, if x is odd then after that x is not equal to the input.
It should be `x = console.nextInt();`

2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

x = 5, y = 4.
computeSum:45, Adder.

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

args = []
console = "..."
x = 5
y = 4
sum = 1
